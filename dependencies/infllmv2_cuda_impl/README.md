# InfLLM V2 CUDA Kernel Implementation

[English](README.md) | [中文](README_zh.md)

This repository contains the optimized CUDA kernel implementation for **InfLLM V2's Two-Stage Sparse Attention Mechanism**. Our implementation provides high-performance kernels for both Stage 1 (Top-K Context Selection) and Stage 2 (Sparse Attention Computation), enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to efficiently process long contexts with trainable sparse patterns.

## Overview

InfLLM V2 introduces a novel two-stage approach for efficient long-context processing:
- **Stage 1: Top-K Context Selection**: Block scoring and aggregation using semantic kernels (kernel computes and aggregates scores, selection performed externally)
- **Stage 2: Sparse Attention Computation**: Attention calculation on selected blocks

This CUDA kernel implementation includes both stages, providing:
- Optimized relevance score computation and aggregation for Stage 1 (Top-K selection performed externally)
- Efficient sparse attention on selected blocks for Stage 2
- Significant reduction in computational costs for both forward and backward phases


Built upon [FlashAttention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention), our kernels leverage efficient memory access patterns and optimized implementations for both stages.

## Two-Stage Architecture

### Stage 1: Top-K Context Selection
The Top-K selection stage involves three sequential steps:
1. **Relevance Score Computation**: Computing scores between query tokens and each semantic kernel (compressed representations of key-value blocks), followed by softmax normalization
2. **Score Aggregation**: Aggregating relevance scores for each semantic kernel across the query group dimension using dimension reduction (hdim16_reduce)
3. **Block Selection (Post-processing)**: Selecting the top-K context blocks for each query token based on the aggregated scores

Note: The `infllmv2_attn_stage1` kernel handles steps 1 and 2 (score computation and aggregation). Only step 3 (Top-K selection) is performed outside the kernel.

### Stage 2: Sparse Attention Computation
The sparse attention stage performs standard attention computation, but only on the blocks selected in Stage 1:
- Support for both forward and backward passes
- Efficient memory access through block-sparse patterns

## Kernel Design Features
- **Token-level Query, Block-level Key-Value**: Avoids training-inference inconsistency during decoding
- **Trainable Context Selection**: Semantic kernels updated indirectly through token-level key vector optimization
- **Selective Block Attention**: Performs attention only on blocks selected in Stage 1

## Kernel Implementation Details

### Stage 1 Kernels
- `infllmv2_attn_stage1`: Calculates similarity scores between query tokens and compressed key representations
- Performs score aggregation across query group dimension (hdim16_reduce)
- Returns aggregated attention scores for subsequent Top-K selection (selection performed outside the kernel)
- Support for causal masking and variable sequence lengths

### Stage 2 Kernels
- `infllmv2_sparse_attn_fwd`: Forward pass kernel for sparse attention
- `infllmv2_sparse_attn_bwd`: Backward pass kernel for training

## Usage

### CUDA Kernel API

The InfLLM V2 CUDA kernel provides the following interfaces for the two-stage sparse attention:

#### Stage 1: Attention Score Computation and Aggregation (feature_infer branch)

```python
from infllm_v2 import infllmv2_attn_stage1

# Stage 1: Compute and aggregate relevance scores between queries and semantic kernels
# This kernel performs:
#   1. LSE approximation using compressed keys
#   2. Full attention score computation
#   3. Score aggregation across query group dimension (hdim16_reduce)
# Top-K selection must be performed separately on the aggregated scores
#
# Inputs:
#   - q: Query tensor (batch_size * n_heads, seqlen_q, head_dim)
#   - k: Compressed key tensor representing semantic kernels
#   - v: Placeholder tensor (not used in score computation)
#   - cu_seqlens_q, cu_seqlens_k: Cumulative sequence lengths
#   - max_seqlen_q, max_seqlen_k: Maximum sequence lengths

# Returns aggregated attention scores for subsequent Top-K selection
aggregated_scores = infllmv2_attn_stage1(
    q, k, v,
    cu_seqlens_q=cu_seqlens_q,
    cu_seqlens_k=cu_seqlens_k,
    max_seqlen_q=max_seqlen_q,
    max_seqlen_k=max_seqlen_k,
    causal=True,  # Apply causal masking
    return_attn_probs=True  # Return attention scores
)

# Top-K selection should be performed on the returned aggregated scores
# (This step is not part of the kernel)
```

#### Stage 2: Sparse Attention Computation

```python
from infllm_v2 import infllmv2_attn_varlen_func

# Stage 2: Sparse Attention Computation Kernel
# Inputs:
#   - q_unpad: Queries tensor (token-level)
#   - k_unpad, v_unpad: Keys and Values tensors (block-level)
#   - cu_seqlens_q, cu_seqlens_k: Cumulative sequence lengths
#   - topk_idx: Selected block indices from Stage 1
#   - max_seqlen_q, max_seqlen_k: Maximum sequence lengths
#   - block_window_size: Optional local attention window size

out_unpad = infllmv2_attn_varlen_func(
    q_unpad, k_unpad, v_unpad,
    cu_seqlens_q, cu_seqlens_k,
    topk_idx,  # Block indices selected in Stage 1
    max_seqlen_q, max_seqlen_k,
    block_window_size = 0,  # Additional local window for attention
)
```

### Kernel Parameters

- **k**: Compressed key tensor representing semantic kernels
- **causal**: Whether to apply causal masking
